### About Me 

I will join the Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial Economics at Singapore Management University as a research fellow this fall. My current research focuses on understanding how agents insure against risk and the implications of heterogeneity on economic outcomes. My C.V. can be found [here](https://xmgbautista.github.io/assets/cv/cv_xmgbautista.pdf).
