### About Me

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am in the Faculty of Economics at Fulbright University Vietnam. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Houston. My research interests are in quantitative macroeconomics and the economics of the household. My work to date broadly covers the topics of household debt and homeownership, consumption and saving, financial inclusion, labor markets, and fiscal policy.
