## About Me
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am a Research Fellow at the Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial Economics at Singapore Management University. I received my Ph.D. in 
Economics from the University of Houston, and my B.A. in Economics and in Mathematics from Brandeis University. <br>
<br>
My research interests are in macroeconomics, household finance, and labor economics. I study the aggregate and distributional effects of 
agents' consumption, labor, and financial decisions on the economy. My research investigates crucial mechanisms by integrating theory and 
microdata using computational and econometric methods.
