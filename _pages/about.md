## About Me
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am a Research Fellow at the Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial Economics at Singapore Management University. I received my Ph.D. in 
Economics from the University of Houston, and my B.A. in Economics and in Mathematics from Brandeis University. 
<br>
<br>
My research interests are in macroeconomics and household finance. I study the aggregate and distributional effects of agents' consumption 
and savings decisions, household debt, labor choices, and heterogeneity. In my research, I focus on key economic mechanisms by integrating 
economic theory and data using computational and econometric methods.
