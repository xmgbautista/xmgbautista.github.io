### About Me

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am a Research Fellow at Singapore Management University. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Houston. <br>
<br>
My research interests are in macroeconomics and household finance. The questions I am interested in typically focus on how microeconomic 
decisions, particularly those of consumers, affect the macroeconomy and vice versa. My work to date broadly covers the topics of 
household debt, consumer theory, financial inclusion, and the macroeconomic aspects of labor and public economics.
