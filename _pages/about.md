### About Me

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am a post-doctoral Research Fellow at the Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial Economics at Singapore Management University. 
I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Houston. <br>
<br>
My research interests are in quantitative macroeconomics and household finance. The questions I am typically interested in focus 
on household financial decision-making and the heterogeneous effects of macroeconomic policies. My work to date broadly covers the 
topics of household debt, consumer theory, financial inclusion, and the macroeconomic aspects of labor economics.
