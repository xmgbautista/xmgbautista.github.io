### About Me

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am a post-doctoral Research Fellow at the Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial Economics at Singapore Management University. 
I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Houston. <br>
<br>
My research interests are in quantitative macroeconomics and household finance. I study the mechanisms that link 
consumption, labor choices, and financial decisions, typically using calibrated or structurally estimated heterogeneous-agent 
models.
