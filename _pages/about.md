### About Me

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am a post-doctoral Research Fellow at the Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial Economics at Singapore Management University. 
I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Houston. <br>
<br>
My primary research interests are in quantitative macroeconomics and household finance. I study the mechanisms that link 
consumption, labor supply, and financial decisions by developing and structurally estimating empirically consistent 
heterogeneous-agent models.
