### About Me

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am in the Faculty of Economics at Fulbright University Vietnam. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Houston.
<br>
<br>

My research interests are in macroeconomics and household finance. The questions I am interested in typically focus on the interactions between household consumption and macroeconomic phenomena. My work to date broadly covers the topics of household debt, consumer theory, financial inclusion, and the macroeconomic aspects of labor and public economics.
