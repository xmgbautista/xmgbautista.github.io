### About Me

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am a Research Fellow at the Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial Economics at Singapore Management University. I received my Ph.D. in 
Economics from the University of Houston and my B.A. in Economics and in Mathematics from Brandeis University. <br>
<br>
My research interests are in quantitative macroeconomics and household finance. My current research focuses on modeling the behavior of 
agents in a way that is consistent with empirical evidence. I am particularly interested in quantifying how much consumption is smoothed 
through different channels and identifying new mechanisms of how household debt and credit affect life cycle decisions.
