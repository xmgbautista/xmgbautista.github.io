### About Me

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am a member of the Faculty of Economics at Fulbright University Vietnam. Previously, I was a Research Fellow at the Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial Economics at Singapore Management University. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Houston. 
<br>
<br>

My areas of research are quantitative macroeconomics and the economics of the household. Using heterogeneous-agent models, I study how the decisions of households, firms, and other economic agents influence economic phenomena. My work to date broadly covers the topics of household debt, consumption, financial inclusion, and labor markets.
