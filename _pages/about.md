I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Houston in 2021. I will join the Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial Economics at Singapore Management University as a research fellow this fall. 
<br>

My research interests are in macroeconomics, consumption, and household finance, with a focus on understanding how agents insure against risk and the implications of heterogeneity on economic outcomes.
