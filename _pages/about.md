## About Me
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am a Research Fellow at the Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial Economics at Singapore Management University. I received my Ph.D. in 
Economics from the University of Houston and my B.A. in Economics and in Mathematics from Brandeis University. <br>
<br>
My research interests are in macroeconomics, household finance, and labor economics. I study the aggregate and distributional effects of 
households' consumption, labor, and financial decisions on the economy. My current research focuses on understanding the endogeneity of 
the distribution of the marginal propensity to consume and how financial decisions over the life cycle affect consumption smoothing.
