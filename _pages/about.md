### About Me

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am a member of the Faculty of Economics at Fulbright University Vietnam. Previously, I was a Research Fellow at the Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial Economics at Singapore Management University. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Houston. 
<br>
<br>

My areas of research are quantitative macroeconomics, economics of the household, and structural estimation. Using heterogeneous-agent models, I study how the decisions of households in various markets influence economic phenomena and the distributions of macroeconomic variables. My work to date broadly covers the topics of household debt, consumption, financial inclusion, labor markets, housing and spatial economics, and fiscal policy.
