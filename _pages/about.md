### About Me

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am in the Faculty of Economics at Fulbright University Vietnam. Previously, I was a Research Fellow at the Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial Economics at Singapore Management University. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Houston.
<br>

My research interests are in macroeconomics and household finance. The questions I am interested in typically focus on the interactions between consumer decisions and macroeconomic phenomena. My work to date broadly covers the topics of household debt, consumer theory, financial inclusion, and the macroeconomic aspects of labor and public economics.
