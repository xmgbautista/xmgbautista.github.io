## About Me
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am a Research Fellow at the Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial Economics at Singapore Management University. I received my Ph.D. in 
Economics from the University of Houston and my B.A. in Economics and in Mathematics from Brandeis University. <br>
<br>
My research interests are in quantitative macroeconomics, household finance, and labor economics. My current research focuses on modeling 
the behavior of agents in a way that is consistent with empirical evidence and quantifying how much consumption is smoothed through 
different channels.
